[ENTRY 1/4]^^It has been two weeks since the Chase first arrived on our planet.^At first, we thought they were here to help us.^They came in peace, offering us advanced technology and knowledge.^But we were fools to trust them.^^It wasn't long before they revealed their true intentions.^They began to infiltrate our governments and military, using their advanced technology to take control.^And now, they are attacking our cities and enslaving our people.^^I don't know how much longer we can hold out against them. They are powerful and ruthless, and they show no mercy.^^I fear for the future of our planet and our people.
